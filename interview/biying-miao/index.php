    <!-- // Question -->
    <dt class="interview-q">Where did you grow up and what were you like as a child?</dt>
    <!-- // Answer -->
    <dd class="interview-a">
      <p>My family moved to Canada from Shanghai when I was in fourth grade, and I grew up in Toronto. I was a very creative child who loved drawing and making things with my hands. Coming from a Chinese family, I was encouraged to play music but gravitated toward freeform arts, so learning an instrument in the classical sense never became something that I honed. I actually wish that I had done that. My 3D printers sound like singing robots, so that’s the music I make now. I’m sure if I put the time in, I could remix it into a pretty sweet song.</p>
      <p>I was always a bit of an art and music geek so when it came time to choose a career path I leaned toward architecture because it was a mix of art, science, and technology; all things that are very much a part of who I am.</p>

    <!-- // Question -->
    <dt class="interview-q">How do you explain your work to people who have never seen a 3D printer before and what do your parents think of Hot Pop Factory?</dt>
    <!-- // Answer -->
    <dd class="interview-a">
      <p>In order to teach people what do we began leading workshops. We encourage folks to come in, get their hands dirty with the technology, and see the printers in action.</p>
      <p>Because digital fabrication has the capacity to realize a wide variety of ideas, our projects tend to range a lot in size, application, and industry - from designers, to brands, to hardware startups. I tell my parents that I make things with robots. That’s kind of a whimsical way of describing the nitty-gritty, but they’re always intrigued.</p>

    <dt class="interview-q">Hot Pop Factory offers <a href="http://www.hotpopfactory.com/workshops/" target="_blank" class="ng-scope">workshops</a> to people interested in learning more about digital fabrication. Who seems most interested in and receptive to these workshops?</dt>
    <!-- // Answer -->
    <dd class="interview-a">
      <p>When we first started the workshops we received a lot of interest from young professionals in the design and engineering fields hoping to make the transition to 3D. Since then, we continue to meet people across different industries. I think this is because the technology intrigues so many people, no matter what field they’re in. We try to offer very accessible workshops, and love the interest that people have expressed so far.</p>

    <!-- // Question -->
    <dt class="interview-q">You received a bachelor’s degree from the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/architecture/" target="_blank" class="ng-scope">School of Architecture at the University of Waterloo</a>. I’m curious about your previous exposure to digital fabrication and 3D technologies while you were in school.</dt>
    <!-- // Answer -->
    <dd class="interview-a">
      <p>The design process for an architect always includes making scaled models before construction because you’re often dealing with large buildings and big budgets. We used digital fabrication to translate our drawings, which lived in the computer, into physical reality as scaled 3D-printed models. When I was going to school this was still a really expensive technology, so we only used it for big budget projects. Otherwise we would make the models by hand. Throughout my architecture career, I began to see the transition from completely hand-made models to digitally fabricated ones. That became a real fascination for me, because it can be quite tedious trying to build curves with 2D pieces of card. As the technology improved, we were making finished products rather than just prototypes or scaled models. This was when I began to transition into creating 3D printed products by Hot Pop Factory.</p>
