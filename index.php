    <!-- // Q & A -->
    <dl class="border">
      <!-- // Question -->
      <dt class="interview-q">So you’ve done a ton of different things. You are a coder, a designer and an entrepreneur?</dt>
      <!-- // Answer -->
      <dd class="interview-a">
        <p>Yes, mostly an entrepreneur and a product designer. Certainly these days, I’m more of an entrepreneur.</p>
      </dd>

      <!-- // Question -->
      <dt class="interview-q">I wanted to speak with you in particular because I knew that you recently founded your startup, <a href="https://reactioncommerce.com/" title="Reaction Commerce website">Reaction Commerce</a>, but you never struck me as that kind of person, as an “entrepreneur,” in the loaded sense. So I wanted to hear more about how you got to where you are today.</dt>
      <!-- // Answer -->
      <dd class="interview-a">
        <p>Well, we could get into where things started for me.</p>
        <p>I’ve been working since the early stages of the web, starting with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities" title="GeoCities article">GeoCities</a>, then Yahoo! for 5 years, then Etsy, and really, I’ve been building and designing products for different audiences for almost my whole career. The natural evolution of starting my own company just seemed to flow from all those experiences. I was doing this for other people’s ideas, and then I saw this need in ecommerce. Along with my cofounder, <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronsjudd" title="Aaron Judd on Twitter">Aaron Judd</a>, we decided that it was time to build a new modern ecommerce platform, Reaction.</p>

      <p>I've always been a tinkerer, especially when it comes to technology.</p>

    <!-- // Q & A -->
    <dl class="border">
      <!-- // Question -->
      <dt class="interview-q">As a child, did you know you were going to end up in the tech scene? What did you want to do when you were growing up?</dt>
      <!-- // Answer -->
      <dd class="interview-a">
        <p>I wanted to be an architect for a period of time when I was a kid, and I was also attracted to social work and psychology for a while. I’ve always been a tinkerer, especially when it comes to technology, and I’ve always liked reverse engineering to figure out how things work. I first learned how to write HTML, CSS and JavaScript by looking at the source code and asking myself, “How did they do that?” It was that type of curiosity that drove me, but not necessarily toward the path of an entrepreneur.</p>
      </dd>

      <!-- // Question -->
      <dt class="interview-q">So then you probably couldn’t have imagined that you would be here doing what you’re doing today?</dt>
      <!-- // Answer -->
      <dd class="interview-a">
        <p>Certainly not. I don’t think most of us could have imagined that there would be the internet, mobile phones, WiFi or even email. There have been so many defining changes in our recent generations that nobody foresaw, really.</p>
      </dd>

      <!-- // Question -->
      <dt class="interview-q">Definitely not.</dt>
      <!-- // Answer -->
      <dd class="interview-a">
        <p>How we consume information. How we shop. How we work. How we think. How we interact with each other. It’s incredibly amazing. None of this was really on my radar when I was studying in school.</p>

    <!-- // Q & A -->
    <dl class="border">
      <!-- // Question -->
      <dt class="interview-q">Tell us how you got started with Geocities. I had a GeoCities site when I was, like, 8, and it was so bad. It was a fansite about the show Daria and it was only compatible with Netscape Navigator. How did you get into that? And what was it like back in the day?</dt>
      <!-- // Answer -->
      <dd class="interview-a">
        <p>Well, I went to UCLA and graduated with a degree in social psychology. I thought I was going to go into a career of social work. Post college, I was doing volunteer coordinating for non-profits. What frustrated me about community organizing was that it was so dependent on funding grants. Everything was grant to grant to grant. You never knew if the organization was going to be able to sustain itself. Funding was decreasing, and I could see the writing on the wall.</p>
          <p>Around this time, GeoCities launched. A friend of mine forwarded me a job opening for a senior community coordinator at GeoCities, and it was like a light bulb went off. In non-profit, we were doing these grassroots community meetups across Los Angeles and touching maybe 30 people at a time. At GeoCities, I could coordinate communities on the web and touch tens of thousands, if not millions, of people! And, it involved the internet which was quickly becoming a passion of mine. I got the job, managing the community leader program of all these neighborhoods.</p>
