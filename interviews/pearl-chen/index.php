      <!-- // Question -->
      <dt class="interview-q">What was growing up like and how did you get interested in technology?</dt>
      <!-- // Answer -->
      <dd class="interview-a">
        <p>My parents immigrated when I was ten months old to Regina, Saskatchewan. I grew up with three older brothers and all of us ended up in technology, despite neither of our parents being computer literate. I was the youngest so I had to fight for the things I wanted. That’s probably why I’m good at working in this male-dominated field, because if you want something you have to fight for it.</p>
        <p>I was fairly tomboyish; I played sports all through elementary and high school. I played basketball on a co-ed team. I learned that when you want to do something, it shouldn’t matter who you’re doing it with. Just do what you want to do.</p>

        <p>We were a stereotypical prairie Chinese family [The Canadian prairies stretch over Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan.] We owned a Chinese restaurant. I worked there from when I was twelve. When it wasn’t busy I would read. We had a library half a block away, and if I was interested in something I would clear out that section and read whatever was there. I remember getting a book on BASIC and typing out programs from it. Doing those exercises early on made me realize technology is something you can actually control; you can have it do anything, or make something out of nothing. That was probably the first time I started programming.</p>

      <dd class="interview-a">
        <p>My parents actually wanted me to watch more TV and read less, but I found it pretty good to ignore what they told me to do. I had a great teacher in Grade 6, Mr. Smith. He had a creative writing and reading curriculum that was atypical of most other Grade 6 programs. We read and did creative writing exercises every day with him. Up until that point, it seemed predestined that I was going to be some kind of doctor or scientist, like every typical, Chinese immigrant's dream! The thought of having a creative career didn’t cross my mind until I realized that I was actually a pretty good writer, a creative writer.</p>

      <!-- // Answer -->
      <dd class="interview-a">
        <p>I left Regina to go to the University of Ottawa. I started out in marketing but
          I didn’t like it, so I switched to computer science. Although I loved those
          classes, I didn’t see myself becoming a computer scientist. So I applied to a
          Fine Arts program at <a href="http://www.ryerson.ca/index.html" target="_blank">Ryerson University</a> in Toronto called <a href="http://imagearts.ryerson.ca/newmedia.html" target="_blank">New Media</a> which was, at that time, part of a department called “Image Arts” and it had a mix of film and photography, along with new media. It focused on interactive art installations, which were fairly new at the time. That meant learning how to use electronics to sense when people were in rooms or to react to people. It was so
          different from anything else that I knew.</p>
          <p>My electronics teacher at that time, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_White">Norman White</a>
          (Ryerson got him to come out of retirement to come and teach), was awesome because he was so good at encouraging people, and he listened. He took my class to the engineering
          department where they actually had a 3D printer, before 3D printers were all the
          rage. It was an eye opener to see that this kind of technology existed.</p>

      <dd class="interview-a">
        <p>I really liked the creative aspect of mixing technology and people, but it was difficult to find a job as an interactive art installation-ist. I had the opportunity to work with a startup that was doing large, Flash web applications. There were only eight people there when I started, so I was doing everything from HTML and CSS to writing content. I once sewed curtains for them [laughs]. If you had some sort of ability and could fill in the gaps, you did.</p>
        <p>That was really good for me as a learning experience because I didn’t get pushed into a narrow job description. At night I would still do physical art installations or other projects like that.</p>

      <dt class="interview-q">You spent some time at the CFC (Canadian Film Centre) Media Lab. How did that come about?</dt>
      <!-- // Answer -->
      <dd class="interview-a">
        <p>After working at the startup I was looking for a change. And an
        opportunity came up to go to <a href="http://welcome.cfcmedialab.com">CFC Media Lab</a> on a full scholarship for a five
        month intensive post-graduate program. The program brought in experts to teach
        day or one week sessions with a couple key faculty members. Within two and a
        half months you were supposed to form a group and execute a prototype. </p>
        <p>After that I did a bit of freelance work, and then I returned to
          the CFC to work full-time as the research and technology manager. I was the
          point person for technical questions and resources. Students might come to me
          and say, “I want to make an interactive project with brain reading technology,
          where do I start?” Then I would help them research it and learn how to build it
          themselves. If they weren't technically savvy enough to want to do it on their
          own, or if time was short, then I would either work on their project or hire a
          contractor and manage them. </p>

      <dt class="interview-q">You’ve recently started a project called Code Huddle. Tell us about that.</dt>
      <!-- // Answer -->
      <dd class="interview-a">
        <p>For every new course I want to teach, I have to make the curriculum from
          scratch. I thought that seemed really stupid. The idea behind <a href="http://codehuddle.org">Code Huddle</a> is
          that I can make curriculum material that someone else can remix, or if I have a
          new course to teach I can remix other people’s material.</p>
          <p>It’s a platform for sharing materials and getting analysis and feedback,
          more or less like GitHub for educators, specifically for technology educators.
          I’m envisioning Code Huddle as an open source project, so I don’t have an
          amazing business model around it, but I think people really need it, so I’m
          going to build it — put it out in the wild and hopefully a lot of people will
          use it, and something will come of it. I was hoping to have a beta out for
          people to try early this year, but I started working full-time so I haven’t had
          a lot of time to focus on side projects.</p>

      <!-- // Answer -->
      <dd class="interview-a">
        <p>In 2008, Shawn Pucknell who runs <a href="http://fitc.ca/">FITC</a> events
          reached out to me and asked if I wanted to teach electronics workshops. I
          thought, I don’t know what to teach! He said to just pick a project then work on
          that during the class, so I agreed. My first class was making LED solar
          lanterns, and I had six people turn up. It was basic electronics. I actually
          hired one of those students a year later.</p>
        <p>I see a lot of companies nowadays searching for skilled programmers. I
          think it’s okay to look for someone junior-ish as long as they’re willing to
          learn. It should really be up to the company to figure out what their
          educational program is, whether that means sending them to conferences or
          classes or having internal classes like lunch n' learns. Companies have to have
          a good infrastructure for on-boarding people and helping mentor and train them.</p>
        <p>That's why I do a lot of this public speaking and training. If three years
          from now I wanted to start a company doing interactive projects, I'll have a
          fleet of people that I've worked with or taught in my classes who I know are
          eager to learn and who I can reach out to. It's an investment versus something
          that I do for fun.</p>
        <p>I also like doing in-person workshops because the reaction I get from people
          who are trying to learn is so wonderful. I like converting people who think they
          couldn't do something into people who now think they can.</p>

      <!-- // Question -->
      <dt class="interview-q">A lot of technologists focus on one area, be it front-end development or hardware, but you seem to know and do a lot of things. How do you manage all of that?</dt>
      <!-- // Answer -->
      <dd class="interview-a">
        <p>Yeah, I'm into a lot of things. Part of that may be that a lot of
          technology doesn't exist for very long. When I was programming with Flash – and everyone kind of knows what the <a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/">story</a> is with Flash – I realized that the web was moving away
          from it and that I really should get back to see what was happening with
          JavaScript.</p>
        <p>For some time, Flash was building robust things and JavaScript was
          learning what it was and what people can do with it. Flash ActionScript 2 and
          JavaScript have similar backgrounds but the way people use it is different. It
          wasn't until a few people discovered key things about JavaScript that the
          language became powerful. That made me focus on web front-end dev – HTML, CSS
          and JavaScript – instead of Flash.</p>
        <p>I did some PHP and database programming too because
          when you want to execute an idea, and it's not too complex, you can do
          everything from the front-end to the back-end. It's nice to be a full-stack
          developer. Nowadays it's easier because you can actually create a database with
          JavaScript using <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a>, and then the
          backend or the server can be <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>. It's
          becoming easier to do it all just knowing Javascript. </p>
        <p>I know Java. I know nothing about Ruby, and I know only slightly more than
          nothing about Python. People think I have a lot more experience because I have
          this other hardware background, but it comes down to hands-on experience. Anyone
          could have the experience if they spent a weekend to learn some of these things,
          but most people are busy. Maybe having the time to learn these new tools is what
          seems impressive.</p>

    <dl class="border">
      <!-- // Question -->
      <dt class="interview-q">Do you have much mobile development experience?</dt>
      <!-- // Answer -->
      <dd class="interview-a">
        <p>I have very niche knowledge of <a href="http://www.android.com">Android</a> from the external hardware integration side. That includes NFC [<a href="http://www.nearfieldcommunication.org/">Near Field Communication</a>], which is about interacting with things in the real world, and <a href="http://www.arduino.cc">Arduino</a>,
          which combines my previous electronics background. I can only do some specific
          things with Android development. For example, I could integrate a web app with
          Android, or I could tell you best practices about working with NFC. </p>
        <p>It comes down to the project. Mobile makes sense for certain things that
          are fully immersive, like games, but I think the web has more to offer than
          native mobile development. Most apps are opened once or twice and never opened
          ever again, so why put that time in? That's probably why I don't do a lot of
          mobile development.</p>

          Do you have a conscious preference toward open products as opposed to
          proprietary? </dt>
      <!-- // Answer -->
      <dd class="interview-a">
        <p>When Android started off I liked it because it was the first open source
          mobile operating that had mass appeal. Each application can execute what they
          call an Android intent, and that’s how apps message each other, internally or
          externally. For example, if I have a twitter application and there is a post I
          want to share via email, there would be a popup that would ask me where I wanted
          to share this tweet to. The Android intent can route my share request to
          multiple places, not just my email, like my favourite todo app, <a href="http://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>,
          <a href="http://www.evernote.com">Evernote</a>, or another app I have installed. The way apps behave with each other
          is very open. </p>
        <p>iPhone is like a walled garden; you go into an app, do your thing, and you
          leave. Android is very much a powerhouse tool. When I don't have time to read a
          post from Twitter, I just hit share, I put it in <a href="http://getpocket.com">Pocket</a>, then Pocket does its thing. On iOS, this
          is only possible if the app developer explicitly builds in that Pocket
          integration. With Android, it's just seamless how all these apps talk to each
          other. </p>
        <p>It's not about the open source label but about working in public. Having
          more people working on something is the benefit of open source. You just get so
          much more out of a project by having a network effect, rather than just working
          alone on something. It’s nice when collaboration makes something better. </p>
